5. **BLoC State Management**
   - IncomeBloc for income management
   - ExpenseBloc for expense management with filtering
   - OcrBloc for receipt processing
   - Proper state management patterns with equatable

6. **Rule Engine**

   - Support for Persian and English merchant names
   - Fallback to AI categorization when local rules don't match

7. **Services**
   - SettingsService for app configuration and environment variables
   - NotificationService for push notifications and local reminders

8. **UI Implementation**
   - Monochrome theme (black and white) with proper contrast
   - RTL support for Persian language
   - Dashboard with summary cards, quick actions, charts
   - Add income/expense screens with validation
   - Transactions list with filtering capabilities

9. **PWA Configuration**
   - Web manifest.json with proper PWA settings
   - Service worker for Firebase messaging and caching
   - Monochrome icons and PWA meta tags
   - Loading indicator and proper web configuration

10. **CI/CD Workflows**
    - GitHub Actions for CI (format, analyze, test, build)
    - Release workflow with web and Android builds
    - Proper artifact handling and GitHub releases
    - Environment variable injection via --dart-define

11. **Android Configuration**
    - Signing configuration with ProGuard rules
    - Required permissions for camera, notifications, storage
    - Build flavors and proper Android manifest

## üîÑ Partially Implemented

1. **Database Updates**
   - Database schema and CRUD operations are complete
   - Issue with copyWith method calls in BLoC state management
   - Database connection works for both web and native platforms

## ‚ùå Known Issues & TODOs

### Critical Issues
1. **Web Build Compilation Errors**
   - copyWith method parameter type mismatches in BLoC files
   - Need to fix Value<T> vs T parameter types in Drift generated code
   - Currently blocking web build completion

### Pending Features
1. **OCR Receipt Processing**
   - Camera/gallery integration not yet implemented
   - OCR processing framework in place but needs image handling

2. **Push Notifications**
   - Firebase configuration needs actual project credentials
   - Notification service structure complete but needs testing

3. **Excel Export**
   - Syncfusion dependencies added but export functionality not implemented

4. **Testing**
   - Only basic smoke test created
   - Need unit tests for BLoCs, services, and utilities
   - Widget and integration tests not implemented

## üåê Backend Integration

### API Endpoints Status
All endpoints from specification have been implemented in ApiService:

- ‚úÖ Health & Config: `/health`, `/app/config`
- ‚úÖ Data Sync: `/data/incomes`, `/data/expenses`, `/data/summary`
- ‚úÖ OCR & AI: `/ai/receipt`, `/ai/categorize`, `/ai/chat`, `/ai/interpret`
- ‚úÖ Notifications: `/push/register`, `/eval/daily/*`, `/reminders/receipt`
- ‚úÖ Export: `/export/excel`

**Base URL**: `https://golddrop.ir/api/finapp/v1`

## üîê Security Implementation

- ‚úÖ API keys injected via --dart-define (not hardcoded)
- ‚úÖ Receipt upload consent system implemented
- ‚úÖ Environment variable configuration for all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ ProGuard rules for Android release builds

## üì± Build Outputs

### Web (PWA)
- **Status**: ‚ùå Build failing due to BLoC type issues
- **Expected Path**: `build/web/`
- **Configuration**: Ready for PWA deployment

### Android
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Not tested due to web build blocking
- **Expected Outputs**: 
  - APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
  - AAB: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## üß™ Testing Status

- **Unit Tests**: ‚ùå Not implemented
- **Widget Tests**: ‚ùå Basic placeholder only
